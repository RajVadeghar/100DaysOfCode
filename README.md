# 50DaysOfCode
My _50 Days of Code_ is all about ***Data Structures & Algorithms*** through **C++**. At the end of this course, I think I’ll be getting a lot of practice on Data Structures and Algorithms.<br />

Before going any further, watch this amazing video [cracking interview at FANG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJZCUhxNCv8&t=1468s) <br />

In this video he mentioned below text books as,<br />
The two bibles of coding interview: <br />
For beginners -> [Programming Interview Exposed](https://github.com/shshankar1/ebooks/blob/master/Programming%20Interviews%20Exposed.PDF) <br />
If you feel comfortable with DS & Algos. Then, <br />
For intermediate -> [Cracking the coding interview](https://github.com/alxerg/Books-1/blob/master/Cracking%20the%20Coding%20Interview%2C%206th%20Edition%20189%20Programming%20Questions%20and%20Solutions.pdf) <br /><br />

If the goal is not reached in 50 days. <br />
