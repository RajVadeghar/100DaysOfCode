# 100DaysOfCode
This ***100 Days of Code*** is all about being consistent with something related to code in particular for about 100 days. Maybe, an hour a day makes us go through 100 hours throughout the course. So, 100 hours are more for getting started with something. Therefore, 100 Days of Code. <br /><br />

My _100 Days of Code_ is all about ***Data Structures & Algorithms*** through **C++**. At the end of this course, I think I’ll be getting a lot of practice on Data Structures and Algorithms.<br />

I am a 2nd-year b.tech student with zero or maybe some knowledge of algorithms. Those big O notations and all. I hardly know about them. So, if you get along with this course, you’ll probably learn them too with me. So, let’s keep going.<br />

* First, I've learnt algorithms from this beautiful documentation. [click here](http://discrete.gr/complexity/) <br />

So, you must go through the documentation if you want to follow it in my way. There is a lot of other documentation out there that is more beautiful than this. But, the documentation I mentioned worked for me. <br />

I practiced a lot of code along the way. Sometimes, I code it myself, and other times I took help from the internet. The questions that I practice are {here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LWxA3xiZxUGToD7Nj3fVqSyOs9f5bx_zqsMjaQLcen8/edit#gid=2033272034) <br />

Once go through them and practice one after other. If you have any doubts refer to my code. Since I’m in the learning stage, I can’t guarantee that my codes are efficient. But, I can guarantee you that those questions are challenging and help you go through a lot of practice. This may result in, cracking interviews at ***FANG***. The big four(*Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google*). Hope this excites you now. I’ll also refer to some of the greatest videos one can go through to reach their levels of higher standards.<br /><br />

Before going any further, watch this amazing video [cracking interview at FANG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJZCUhxNCv8&t=1468s) <br />

In this video he mentioned below text books as,<br />
The two bibles of coding interview: <br />
For beginners -> [Programming Interview Exposed](https://github.com/shshankar1/ebooks/blob/master/Programming%20Interviews%20Exposed.PDF) <br />
If you feel comfortable with DS & Algos. Then, <br />
For intermediate -> [Cracking the coding interview](https://github.com/alxerg/Books-1/blob/master/Cracking%20the%20Coding%20Interview%2C%206th%20Edition%20189%20Programming%20Questions%20and%20Solutions.pdf) <br /><br />

If the goal is not reached in 100 days. Then I’ll try to extend it to ***200 Days of Code*** <br />
This, is Raja Narayana, a 2nd year engineering student. <br />
